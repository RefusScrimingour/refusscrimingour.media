# My GitHub Pages :D
Hi! I'm Garv. I enjoy things like programming, procrastinating and solving problems. This is a little site to just host my "miscellaneous" content for the web. I used to have a domain before, but that expired, so it will just be scattered around here. The manifest.plist is me trying to get my app from https://github.com/garv-shah/molly to install through safari (didn't work btw) and the two fake news folders are websites I created for my English project. Not a very interesting page, but look around if you'd like! <br>
